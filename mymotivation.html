            Motivation is the reason for people's actions, willingness and goals. Motivation has been considered as one of the most important reasons that inspires a person to move forward in life. 
              Motivation results from the interaction of both conscious and unconscious factors. Mastering motivation to allow sustained and deliberate practice is central to high levels of achievement e.g. in the worlds of elite sport, medicine or music.
              <br/><br/><b>The following are the types of motivation:</b>
              <ul style="text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
                <li>Intrinsic motivation:</b> This is when motivation comes from "internal" factors to meet personal needs. We do things we do because we enjoy them, not because we have to. </li>
                <br/><br/><li><b>Extrinsic motivation:</b> This is when motivation comes from "external" factors that are given or controlled by others.</li>
                <br/><br/><li><b>Positive Motivation:</b>
                  Positive motivation or incentive motivation is based on reward. The workers are offered incentives for achieving the desired goals. The incentives may be in the shape of more pay, promotion, recognition of work, etc. The employees are offered the incentives and try to improve their performance willingly.
                  According to Peter Drucker, the real and positive motivators are responsible for placement, high standard of performance, information adequate for self- control and the participation of the worker as a responsible citizen in the plant community. Positive motivation is achieved by the co-operation of employees and they have a feeling of happiness.</li>
                  <br/><br/><li><b>Negative Motivation:</b>
                  Negative or fear motivation is based on force or fear. Fear causes employees to act in a certain way. In case, they do not act accordingly then they may be punished with demotions or lay-offs. The fear acts as a push mechanism. The employees do not willingly co-operate, rather they want to avoid the punishment.
                  Though employees work up-to a level where punishment is avoided but this type of motivation causes anger and frustration. This type of motivation generally becomes a cause of industrial unrest. In spite of the drawbacks of negative motivation, this method is commonly used to achieve desired results. There may be hardly any management which has not used negative motivation at one or the other time.

            You are fairly <em><b><u>extrinsically motivated </em></b></u> and just a little <u><em><b>intrinsically motivated. </em></b></u>. 
            That you are reasonably extrinsically motivated means that you take into account what you can achieve with your studies: 
            a diploma, money, status or the recognition of the people you love. The fact that you are not intrinsically motivated means that, in your studies, 
            you are not guided much by your interest and preferences. 
            Studying can be quite hard for you: you don't really like it, and you can feel like you have to drag yourself through it.
            <br/><br/>I can recognize myself in the results of the test. I noticed that I may not be so comfortable in this course after all. 
            The first two weeks when we started making this website, from scratch, I really liked to do, because that also includes the piece of design which suits me well. 
            The lessons of Programming Basics, for example, are not at all mine. I didn't think it was a great thing to do either. 
            But then there are the Computer Science lessons that I found interesting. So my conclusion now is that I still don't know what to do with my studies.

              <li><b>Creativity (21 points):</b> 
                This is a very good example of me. I am very creative and I notice that in everything, everyday life, assignments for school, hobby and you name it. 
                So I had some expectations that this would be at the top. For example, with the first assignment, website building, 
                I also liked the CSS part because you can invent and apply your own design there.</li>
              <li><b>Wealth (18 points): </b>
                I can understand this result somewhere. I do have the dream later to have my own company, maybe with my current boyfriend, and to become successful with it. 
                The additional money is not wrong, of course, and I am certainly going for that. My own company can be anything, but I'll see what I'm going to delve into later.
                </li>
              <li><b>Norms and values (0 points):</b>
                I'm a little surprised by this result. I'd like to do something for the world later, don't get me wrong, but it won't be something big and exuberant. Overall, I'm quite helpful anyways, so I don't really agree with this number of points.

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
            My motivation is a long way off right now. I don't think this study is right for me after all. 
            I do all the assignments because they I have to and I don't always find their content interesting. 
            I noticed that I am stressing a lot about school. My head is way too full and therefore I have a lot of headaches and my fatigue doesn't help either. 
            So my motivation is low anyway and I am really upset about that.
