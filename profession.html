        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">Five different types of ICT organizations and their cultures</h2>
        <p>
          <ul style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
            <li>Macaw is certified as a Great Place to Work. Great Place to Work Netherlands investigates the level of trust, pride and fun within organisations. 
              The results of the employee survey and the analysis of the organizational culture within Macaw show that Macaw scores highly on this. 
              More than 200 of the then more than 250 Macawers (now more than 350) participated in the research and we are of course very happy with that.</li>
              <br/><br/><li>Centric. People are at the heart of our organization. Our employees make Centric a success. 
              That's why we invest in personal guidance, development opportunities and vitality programs. 
              We do everything we can to provide a working environment where everyone can come into their own and continue to develop. 
              Centric'ers are not afraid to leave the beaten path and feel involved in their work. They do what they promise and stand for what they do.</li>
              <br/><br/><li>YourSurprise. I think this piece of text reflects the culture of your surprise. We love to share our successes and celebrate with colleagues, 
              so if YourSurprise has done well, it means we've all worked hard. And that should be rewarded with a good party. We love to create beautiful moments,
               not only for our customers, but also for ourselves. At work, but also outside, where we meet in our in-house gym, 
               at the quiz night or during a fun weekend away with the whole company.</li>
               <br/><br/><li>Veracoders are dedicated to creating a world where the software fueling our economic growth and solving some of society's greatest challenges is developed secure 
              from the start. The Veracode Way is the foundation of our culture. It guides our behavior, decisions, and actions toward our 
              stakeholders, employees, customers, investors, and the broader community. 
              We work hard to create an environment where employees experiment, learn, imagine, play, create, and treat each other kindly.</li>
              <br/><br/><li>Google’s culture is flexible (employees are encouraged to work when they like and how they like), fun (offices have nap pods, video games and ping pong) 
              and founded on trust. Collaboration is key – so much so that employees are encouraged to coach each other in the ‘Googler to Googler’ programme. 
              This includes key business skills such as public speaking, management and orientation as well as extra-curricular activities like kickboxing.</li>

              By inspiring and taking them towards a future-proof and valuable data platform that can support all traditional and innovative data driven workloads.
              And we also go a step further, building fully intrigued analytics solutions that directly contribute to our customer's services."

            <br/><br/><li>As a Functional Designer, you have a very wide range of tasks. The nice thing about this feature is that you are able to stand between the customers and the technology. 
              You are responsible for mapping the wishes and requirements for new software to be built or modifications to our current software. 
              When you have come to a useful solution, you will work with the scrum team with your functional design and the associated requirements. 
              You take into account the preconditions and technical specifications.
