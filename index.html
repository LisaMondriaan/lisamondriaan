                <b>I am more into practical lessons than theory lessons. On the university level it's more about the theory, that means you have to learn more from books.
                    You also have workcolleges and hearingcolleges with so many people and I don't think I would be happy with that, but I do want to go to Univerity after my study on the HBO.</b>

                <b>I was always good with computers and at school I had the subject called informatica, where we did pretty cool projects. 
                    I needed to build an app that could control a robot that we also had to build. But because of corona we could not properly finnish the project. 
                    My father is the ICT team leader at Scalda and I think that also played a role in my choice for ICT. So I have already learned a lot from him about computers.</b>
